1. Using swagger 
Refer - "day13-data\day13_help\Regarding Swagger.txt"
Test the application with swagger as a REST client.

Enter Advanced REST

2 E-R with REST API
Un comment the association from Category class.
Generate suitable constructor
Exclude association fields from toString , to avoid recursion n thus leading to stack overflow

2.1 Run the end point - get all categories  

Observation - Exception
Details - org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotWritableException: Could not write JSON: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: com.blogs.entities.Category.posts, could not initialize proxy - no Session

Cause -Category 1->* Post
Default fetch type : LAZY  (i.e post details are NOT lifted from DB -- represented by a proxy) --can't be access outside the session scope. 

Soln -- change LAZY --> EAGER

2.2 Eager fetching ?
Observation - stack overflow to due recursion
root cause - bi dir association
(during ser Jackson from category --tries to ser posts n from post tries to ser. Category)
(For understanding the problem - run postman client)

2.3 Use @JsonIgnore (jackson annotation) to tell Jackson(vendor for ser n de-ser) to skip a field during ser n de-ser.
Not an effective solution
Reason - If REST clnt needs to fetch category + post details - it won't be possible, since @JsonIgnore is used !!!


2.4 Clean n recommended solution -
DO NOT expose entities for data exchange between REST clnt n REST server , use them only for persistence.

Instead use DTO(Data transfer obj) pattern to exchange data between client n server.
1 Entity --> DTO (is required during ser.)
Create DTO instance , read data from entity(getter) --> set the data in DTO (setter)

DTO --> Entity (is required during de-ser.)
Create entity instance , read data from dto(getter) --> set the data in entity (setter)

2. Instead of doing it ourselves --there are ready made 3rd party libs -
meant for src obj --> dest obj conversion.

eg : ModelMapper, MapStruct
Refer - "day14_help\Advanced REST\readmes\Regarding ModelMapper.txt"

Objective - Create CategoryDTO , with required fields.
Control property access (@JsonProperty) , if required.

Modify service layer , to return List of Category entity or DTO ?

2.1 Replace actual Resource(eg : Employee / Customer / User / Category )  by ResponseEntity
Refer - "Regarding ResponseEntity.txt"

2.5 Lab objective - Add the end point to return Category with given id , along with Post details
i/p - category id
resp - Category + it's post details

2.6 Add new end point
For adding a new blog post.
i/p - title , desc , contents , category id ,  author id 
How will you design it ?

How to control the access to the property during ser/ de-ser ?
Default access -the propety is accessed during sern n de-ser.
To use it only during de-ser
@JsonProperty(access=Access.WRITE_ONLY) //setters

To use it only during ser
@JsonProperty(access=Access.READ_ONLY)// getters



2.7 Update blog post contents
i/p - post id n updated contents
How will you design it ?

2.8 Lab work
Post a comment to the blog post
i/p - comment  , rating  , commenter id , post id


3. Objective : User signin endpoint 
URL : http://host:port/users/signin
Method : POST (for adding email n pwd : in request body as additional security.)


Request Body : DTO (eg : AuthRequestDTO)
Resp : ResponseEntity
Success : SC 200 + UserDTO
Failure : SC 404 + ApiResp (err mesg +timestamp)

4. In case of failure : Client SHOULD NOT see the error stack trace 
INSTEAD
REST server should return Resp packet with : SC 404 n resp body containing : DTO 
with time stamp n err mesg (Hint : Use ApiResponse DTO)

5. What will happen ?
In User sign in
in the JSON payload : send empty payload
Observe n conclude 

Any problem n any solution ?

6. Enter :  REST Server side Validations
(Refer to readme : templates.txt & "regarding spring boot exc handling n validations.txt") 


7. Spring boot testing
Refer - "day14_help\Advanced REST\readmes\Regarding Spring Boot Testing.txt"
Use it for unit testing n integration testing.
